# Sniffer-Exploited
Sniffer Exploited is a Minecraft plugin that aims to make Sniffers actually worth having in the game.

## The backstory

Back in the mob vote, me and my friends wanted the Tuff Golem to win. It was, for us, the most reasonable to have: 3D item frame, customizable, helps story telling (which was kind of the point of 1.20) and Mojang can't let us down by under-delivering features.

In the end, the Sniffer won, and me and my friends were frustrated. The only addition that this mob brought were TWO decorative plants; we felt as if it wasn't worth having in the game. All of us except one of our friends, MaxiTaxi_323, who is obsessed with them, playing all day to farm them and talking about it in vc. One day one of our friends got tired, broke and said **"MAXI, I'LL KILL ALL YOUR SNIFFERS, I'LL MAKE THEM SNIFF SUGAR AND THEY'LL EXPLODE"**.

"Say no more" I said, "I'll make them worth having in the game".

## The features

- Right Click a Sniffer with sugar in your hand to make them sniff it. They'll go crazy for a bit before exploding and dropping a **SNIFFER SNOUT**.

- Right Click while holding a **SNIFFER SNOUT** to use it. It will sniff for ores, revealing them to the player for some time. This feature was inspired by the [Potion of Spelunking Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/potion-of-spelunking) by [DanMizu](https://modrinth.com/user/DanMizu). It supports:
  - All (**vanilla**) ores
  - Deepslate variants
  - Nether ores
  - Budding Amethyst
  - Ancient Debris (sniffing in the nether lasts fewer seconds to balance the mechanic)

- Ore revealing has two modes: ([Check them out in the gallery](https://modrinth.com/plugin/sniffer-exploited/gallery))
  - Block Mode just outlining the block (with block displays).
  - Item Mode showing the ingots (with item displays).
  - Item Mode showing the raw minerals (with item displays). 

#### Not yet implemented as of `v0.1-beta`:

- You can use a Torch Flower in a brewing stand to transform an Awkward Potion into a Potion of **Glowing** that lasts 1:30.

- You can use a Pitcher Plant in a brewing stand to transform an Awkward Potion into a Potion of **Hunger** that lasts 0:45.

- Using Redstone in a brewing stand will transform both of this potions into their longer lasting counterparts, with the Potion of Glowing lasting 4:00 and the Potion of Hunger lasting 1:30.

- Using Glowstone Dust in a brewing stand will transform the Potion of Hunger into a Potion of Hunger **II** lasting 0:22.5.

- Both this potions and their variants can be converted into Splash and Lingering potions as well.

## The configs

## The extra info

No, you don't need any resource packs for this to work. If you have another idea for making the Sniffer worth having, don't hesitate and share it in the repo's discussions.
