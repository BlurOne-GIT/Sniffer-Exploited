# Sniffer-Exploited
Sniffer Exploited is a Minecraft plugin that aims to make Sniffers actually worth having in the game.

## The backstory

Back during the mob vote, me and my friends wanted the Tuff Golem to win. It was, for us, the most reasonable to have: "3D item frame, customizable, helps story telling (which was kind of the point of 1.20) and Mojang can't let us down by under-delivering features".

Sadly, we ended up getting the Sniffer. With the only addition of TWO decorative plants, we felt as if it wasn't worth having in the game. That was, of course, with the exception of one wierdo, MaxiTaxi_323, who is obsessed with Sniffers, playing all day to farm them, giving them stupid names and talking about it in vc. One day, one of my friends got tired of him, broke and said **"MAXI, I'LL KILL ALL YOUR SNIFFERS, I'LL MAKE THEM SNIFF SUGAR AND THEY'LL EXPLODE"**.

"Say no more" said the programmer (that's me!!1!), "I'll make them worth having in the game".

## The features

- Right Click a Sniffer with sugar in your hand to make them sniff it. They'll go crazy for a bit before exploding and dropping a **Potion of Sniffing**.
- Giving the Sniffer more sugar while it's running will make the explosion bigger. But be careful, don't give him way too much!

- Drinking a **Potion of Sniffing** will make you sniff for ores, revealing them to the player for some time. This feature was inspired by the [Potion of Spelunking Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/potion-of-spelunking) by [DanMizu](https://modrinth.com/user/DanMizu). The sniffing effect supports:
  - All (**vanilla**) ores
  - Deepslate variants
  - Nether ores
  - Budding Amethyst
  - Ancient Debris (sniffing in the nether lasts fewer seconds to balance the mechanic)

- **Splash** and **Lingering** variants of the potion can also be brewed, having the corresponding intensity and duration mechanics for each of them.

- In slime chunks, Sniffers are able to dig up slime balls, making for a great vanilla-friendly slime chunk detector.

- Ore revealing has two modes: ([Check them out in the gallery](https://modrinth.com/plugin/sniffer-exploited/gallery))
  - Block Mode just outlining the block (with block displays).
  - Item Mode showing the ingots (with item displays).
  - Item Mode showing the raw minerals (with item displays).

(and probably won't be for a long time because of issues with nms)

- You can use a Torch Flower in a brewing stand to transform an Awkward Potion into a Potion of **Glowing** that lasts 1:30.

- You can use a Pitcher Plant in a brewing stand to transform an Awkward Potion into a Potion of **Hunger** that lasts 0:45.

- Using Redstone in a brewing stand will transform both of this potions into their longer lasting counterparts, with the Potion of Glowing lasting 4:00 and the Potion of Hunger lasting 1:30.

- Using Glowstone Dust in a brewing stand will transform the Potion of Hunger into a Potion of Hunger **II** lasting 0:22.5.

- Both this potions and their variants can be converted into Splash and Lingering potions as well.
